# Smartcitizen
SmartCitizen is a web platform that empowers citizens to report local civic issues like potholes, broken streetlights, garbage accumulation, water leakages, or public safety concerns. The system allows authorities (municipal officers, NGOs, or local governance bodies) to track, respond, and resolve reported issues efficiently.
